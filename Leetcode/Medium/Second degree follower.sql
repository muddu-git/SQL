-- Question 70
-- In facebook, there is a follow table with two columns: followee, follower.

-- Please write a sql query to get the amount of each followerâ€™s follower if he/she has one.

-- For example:

-- +-------------+------------+
-- | followee    | follower   |
-- +-------------+------------+
-- |     A       |     B      |
-- |     B       |     C      |
-- |     B       |     D      |
-- |     D       |     E      |
-- +-------------+------------+
-- should output:
-- +-------------+------------+
-- | follower    | num        |
-- +-------------+------------+
-- |     B       |  2         |
-- |     D       |  1         |
-- +-------------+------------+
-- Explaination:
-- Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B's follower is C and D, and D's follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.
 

-- Note:
-- Followee would not follow himself/herself in all cases.
-- Please display the result in follower's alphabet order.

Table Creation Script:
create table follow(followee varchar(100),follower varchar(100))

insert into follow(followee,follower) values('A','B')

insert into follow(followee,follower) values('B','C')

insert into follow(followee,follower) values('B','D')

insert into follow(followee,follower) values('D','E')

Solution:
select  followee as follower ,count(distinct follower) as num from follow 
where followee in (select distinct follower from follow)
group by followee
order by followee

--always use order by to get appropriate result
--count(distinct follower) will give exact distinct followers
